# VEX V5 Practice
A personal project of mine where I'll be practicing the programming of a VEX robot. Specifically, a V5 clawbot with holonomic drive. 

## Goals
One of the main goals of this project is doing everything from scratch. This has two major benefits:

1. Code from this project can be reused in other projects. For example, if a PID movement controller for a holonomic drive is needed, one can be taken from this project.
2. I get to learn more on how to create this systems and algorithms from scratch which is beneficial. 

## Features

### Current
- Driver control from scratch of arm, claw, and movement
- Odometry that tracks position of robot relative to field
- Organized file structure

### Planned
- Implement PID on the drive system, arm, and claw
- Implement autonomous mode selector using LVGL
- Setup system manager classes for arm and claw
- Setup file structure


## Libraries Used
- PROS
